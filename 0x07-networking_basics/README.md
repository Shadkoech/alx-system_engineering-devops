# 0x07. Networking basics #0

This folder holds the major concepts of networking that include:

	- OSI model
	- Different types of network
	- LAN network
	- WAN network
	- Internet
	- MAC address
	- What is an IP address
	- Private and public address
	- IPv4 and IPv6
	- Localhost
	- TCP and UDP
	- TCP/UDP ports List
	- What is ping /ICMP
	- Positional parameters

The tasks below contains both multiple answer questions as well as bash scripts:


## Task 0: OSI model

File

	- OSI model
OSI model?
* 2.The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
How is the OSI model organized?
* 2.From the lowest to the highest level



## Task 1: Types of network

File

	- 1-types_of_network
What type of network a computer in local is connected to?
* 3.LAN
What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?
* 2.WAN
What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?
* 1.Internet



## Task 2: MAC and IP address

File

	- 2-MAC_and_IP_address
What is a MAC address?
* 2.The unique identifier of a network interface
What is an IP address?
* 1.Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
-The analogy in this case is that IP addresses are unique identifiers for devices on a network just like postal addresses are to houses



## Task 3: UDP and TCP

File

	- 3-UDP_and_TCP
Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
* 1.It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
* 2.It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
* 1.Have you received boxes x, y, z?



## Task 4: TCP and UDP ports

File

	- 4-TCP_and_UDP_ports
Bash script that displays listening ports:
* That only shows listening sockets
* That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs



## Task 5: Is the host on the network

File

	- 5-is_the_host_on_the_network
