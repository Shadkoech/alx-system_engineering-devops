It is the role of load balancers to manage connection to these servers such that:

	- Work-load is evenly assigned to available servers
	- Large amount of work is done concurrently
	- There is no single point of failure
	- There is optimization of available resources
	- Ease of scalability (Removing and adding servers with ease)
